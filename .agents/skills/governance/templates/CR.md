=============================================================================
CHANGE REQUEST TEMPLATE GUIDELINES
=============================================================================

0. ID + FILENAME CONVENTION
   - The CR **MUST** have an ID in frontmatter (e.g., `CR-0001`)
   - The file **MUST** be named `CR-0001-{shortName}.md` (ID prefix matches frontmatter `id`)
   - `{shortName}` should be a short, kebab-case slug (e.g., `billing-endpoints`)

1. REQUIREMENTS LANGUAGE (RFC 2119)
   - Use ONLY **MUST** for requirements to ensure unambiguous specification
   - Avoid SHOULD, MAY, RECOMMENDED, OPTIONAL - these create ambiguity
   - If a requirement is not mandatory, it is not a requirement - remove it
   - Example: "The system **MUST** validate email format before submission"

2. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (Given-When-Then)
   - All acceptance criteria **MUST** follow the Given-When-Then formula
   - Given: Precondition or context (the initial state)
   - When: Action or trigger (the behavior being tested)
   - Then: Expected outcome (the result to verify)
   - Example:
     Given a user is authenticated
     When the user submits an idea without a title
     Then the system displays a validation error "Title is required"

3. VISUALIZATIONS (Mermaid Diagrams)
   - All diagrams, flowcharts, and visualizations **MUST** use Mermaid syntax
   - Supported diagram types: flowchart, sequenceDiagram, stateDiagram, erDiagram
   - Example:
     ```mermaid
     flowchart LR
       A[Start] --> B{Decision}
       B -->|Yes| C[Action]
       B -->|No| D[End]
     ```

4. DOCUMENT COMPLETENESS (250+ Lines Minimum)
   - A comprehensive CR **MUST** be at least 250 lines to ensure sufficient detail
   - This minimum ensures that all sections are properly filled out with meaningful content
   - Incomplete or superficial CRs lead to ambiguity, rework, and implementation errors
   - Each section should contain enough detail for implementers to work independently
   - If your CR is under 250 lines, review each section and add:
     * More specific requirements with concrete examples
     * Detailed acceptance criteria covering edge cases
     * Comprehensive impact assessments
     * Additional diagrams to clarify complex flows
     * Thorough risk analysis with mitigation strategies

5. IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION (DeepWiki MCP)
   - Use DeepWiki MCP to validate implementation details against authoritative GitHub repositories
   - DeepWiki MCP provides up-to-date documentation directly from source repositories
   - Before finalizing implementation approach, query DeepWiki MCP for:
     * Current API signatures and method names (avoid outdated documentation)
     * Recommended patterns and best practices from official examples
     * Breaking changes or deprecations in recent versions
     * Configuration options and their correct usage
   - Implementation instructions **MUST** be validated against the source repository to ensure accuracy
   - When referencing external libraries or frameworks:
     * Query DeepWiki with the repository (e.g., `google/adk-go`, `AnswerDotAI/llms-txt`)
     * Document specific topics researched in the `.deepwiki` file
     * Include version-specific details when implementation depends on particular versions
   - Example DeepWiki queries:
     * "How to configure agents in google/adk-go"
     * "Tool registration patterns in google/adk-go"
     * "Session management best practices in google/adk-go"
   - Benefits of DeepWiki validation:
     * Prevents implementation errors from outdated documentation
     * Ensures code examples match current library versions
     * Provides authoritative source for implementation decisions
     * Reduces rework caused by incorrect assumptions

6. TEST STRATEGY (Required for All Code Changes)
   - Every CR involving code changes **MUST** include a comprehensive test strategy
   - The test strategy **MUST** address three categories:
     * **Adding Missing Tests:** Identify functionality that lacks test coverage and specify new tests to be written
     * **Removing Redundant Tests:** Identify tests that become obsolete due to the change and should be removed
     * **Modifying Changed Tests:** Identify existing tests that need updates to reflect new behavior
   - For each test category, specify:
     * Test file location (existing or new)
     * Test function/method names
     * What the test validates
     * Expected inputs and outputs
   - Test coverage requirements:
     * All new functionality **MUST** have corresponding unit tests
     * All modified functionality **MUST** have updated tests reflecting new behavior
     * Integration tests **MUST** be added for cross-component interactions
     * Edge cases and error conditions **MUST** be tested
   - Test removal criteria:
     * Tests for removed functionality **MUST** be deleted
     * Tests that duplicate coverage **MUST** be consolidated
     * Tests that no longer reflect system behavior **MUST** be updated or removed

7. QUALITY STANDARDS COMPLIANCE (Mandatory)
   - Implementation **MUST** meet all project quality standards before completion
   - Code quality requirements:
     * Code **MUST** compile/build without errors
     * All linter checks **MUST** pass with zero warnings/errors
     * Code **MUST** follow project coding conventions and style guides
   - Test quality requirements:
     * All existing tests **MUST** pass after implementation
     * New tests **MUST** achieve adequate coverage for changed code
     * Test code **MUST** follow the same quality standards as production code
   - Documentation requirements:
     * Code changes **MUST** include updated inline documentation where applicable
     * API changes **MUST** include updated API documentation
     * README or user-facing docs **MUST** be updated if behavior changes
   - Review requirements:
     * All changes **MUST** go through code review via pull request
     * PR title **MUST** follow Conventional Commits format
     * Changes **MUST** be squash-merged to maintain linear history
   - Prohibited actions:
     * Committing code that breaks builds
     * Bypassing or weakening tests to force them to pass
     * Using skip flags to avoid running tests
     * Marking tests as @Ignored/@Disabled without explicit approval
